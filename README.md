# NBA-Analytics-and-Predictions-2010-2021
This is an analytical look at both NBA Teams and players performance across 10+ years of play.
NBA team stats were taken from season long games, while players stats were taken per game.
Predictions were made using years of team stats to show which stats and metrics are most effective in
predicting wins across a season.


# Take Away
I created this deployment to show the relation between both teams and players
across a decade of play, to hopefully give a little insight on how the game has changed over
the years, i.e., Evolution of 3 Point attempts and percentages by Teams and Players for example.
